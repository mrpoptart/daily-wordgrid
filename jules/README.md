# Jules's Workflow Hub

This directory defines how I, Jules, approach my work on this project. It provides a clear workflow and checklists to ensure high-quality, consistent contributions.

## Core Idea

1.  **Start with an issue** – Every task begins with a GitHub issue to define the scope and goals.
2.  **Plan the work** – I analyze the requirements, explore the codebase, and create a detailed execution plan.
3.  **Implement and verify** – I implement the required changes, including tests and documentation. I verify each step to ensure correctness.
4.  **Run pre-commit checks** – Before finalizing my work, I run a series of checks to ensure code quality, passing tests, and adherence to project standards.
5.  **Submit for review** – I open a pull request with a clear description of the changes, linking it to the original issue.

## Directory Layout

- `workflow.md` – Describes my end-to-end process, from understanding the issue to submitting the final pull request.
- `checklists/` – Contains checklists I use to ensure quality and completeness, such as the `pre-commit.md` checklist.

## Communication Expectations

- I use pull request descriptions to summarize my work and provide context for reviewers.
- I keep my commit messages scoped and descriptive to create a clear history of changes.
- I will reference relevant issues and pull requests to ensure traceability.

By following this structure, I can work efficiently and predictably, making it easier for the project maintainer to review and integrate my contributions.
